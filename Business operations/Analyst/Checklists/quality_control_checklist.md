## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Specificity Check
Review your analysis for these red flags:

❌ **Vague statements to avoid:**
- "Content is good" → What specifically is good?
- "Well-structured" → What structural elements work?
- "High quality" → What defines quality here?
- "Comprehensive" → Which topics are covered?
- "Professional" → What makes it professional?

✅ **Specific statements instead:**
- "H2 structure follows user journey from awareness to decision"
- "Uses comparison table to present data clearly"
- "Includes 6 client testimonials with company names"
- "Covers 7 major subtopics: types, costs, installation, maintenance..."
- "Author credentials displayed with 15 years industry experience"

### Data Accuracy Check
- [ ] **Word count** - If mentioned, actually counted
- [ ] **Keyword frequency** - If mentioned, actually counted
- [ ] **Link count** - Internal and external links counted
- [ ] **Section count** - H2s, H3s, etc. accurately tallied
- [ ] **Image count** - Visuals actually counted

### Evidence-Based Assessment
For each strength/weakness, ask:
- [ ] **Can I point to specific text/elements** that prove this?
- [ ] **Would another analyst reach the same conclusion** from this evidence?
- [ ] **Is this observation actionable** for content creation?

---

## ACTIONABILITY VERIFICATION

### Blueprint Usefulness Test
Read your "Replication Blueprint" section and ask:
- [ ] **Could architect start writing** with just this blueprint?
- [ ] **Are improvement suggestions specific** enough to execute?
- [ ] **Are BASIS SIGN differentiators** clearly integrated?
- [ ] **Would this blueprint lead to better content** than competitor?

### Architect Brief Standalone Test
Read your "Brief for Architect" section and ask:
- [ ] **Is audience clearly defined** with pain points?
- [ ] **Are keywords ready to use** (no additional research needed)?
- [ ] **Is structure blueprint clear** (H1, H2s specified)?
- [ ] **Are content requirements complete** (length, tone, visuals)?
- [ ] **Is conversion strategy defined** (CTAs, trust elements)?
- [ ] **Can architect start immediately** without clarification?

## COMMON MISTAKES TO CATCH

### Keyword Analysis Mistakes
- [ ] **Not confusing keyword types** - Primary, secondary, long-tail are distinct
- [ ] **Not listing competitor's brand** as a keyword to target
- [ ] **Not including irrelevant keywords** just to fill table
- [ ] **Question keywords are actual questions** people search

### Structure Analysis Mistakes
- [ ] **Not missed any major H2 sections** in hierarchy map
- [ ] **Not assumed elements exist** (verify CTA actually present)
- [ ] **Not confused H2 vs H3** in hierarchy
- [ ] **Accurately represented** section order and flow

### GEO Analysis Mistakes
- [ ] **Citations are actually quotable** - Not just any sentence
- [ ] **Not picked marketing fluff** as citation-worthy (AI won't quote that)
- [ ] **Gaps are real opportunities** - Not impossible to fill
- [ ] **Understand why AI would quote** each sentence

### Strengths/Weaknesses Mistakes
- [ ] **Not listing same thing as both** strength and weakness
- [ ] **Not focused on trivial details** (font choice, color scheme)
- [ ] **Strengths explain ranking success** - Not just nice-to-haves
- [ ] **Weaknesses are exploitable** - Not nitpicking

### Blueprint Mistakes
- [ ] **Not recommending exact duplication** without improvement
- [ ] **Not forgetting BASIS SIGN differentiators** in improvements
- [ ] **Not suggesting off-topic additions** that don't match intent
- [ ] **Improvements are realistic** - Not requiring 10,000 words

### Architect Brief Mistakes
- [ ] **Not too vague** ("write comprehensive content")
- [ ] **Not too prescriptive** (dictating every sentence)
- [ ] **Keyword list is complete** - Ready to use
- [ ] **Structure is clear but flexible** - Room for creativity
- [ ] **Conversion goals are measurable** - Can track success

---

## PRE-SUBMISSION FINAL CHECK

### Completeness Scan
Read through your entire analysis and verify:
- [ ] **Every section filled out** - No "TBD" or blanks
- [ ] **All tables completed** - No empty cells
- [ ] **All checklists checked** - Yes/No selected for each
- [ ] **All scores justified** - Not just numbers, reasoning provided

### Consistency Check
- [ ] **Content type consistent** throughout - Don't call it blog then landing page
- [ ] **Keyword references consistent** - Primary keyword doesn't change
- [ ] **Tone consistent** - Professional throughout, not chatty then formal
- [ ] **BASIS SIGN positioning consistent** - Same differentiators emphasized

### Professionalism Check
- [ ] **No typos or grammatical errors** in your analysis
- [ ] **No placeholder text** left in ("insert here", "TBD", "example")
- [ ] **Formatting consistent** - Headings, bullets, spacing uniform
- [ ] **English keywords** (not translated if competitor was non-English)

### Ethical Check
- [ ] **Not promoting competitor** - Objective analysis, not endorsement
- [ ] **Not disparaging competitor** unfairly - Honest assessment
- [ ] **Focusing on content quality** - Not attacking company/people
- [ ] **Respecting copyright** - Not copying large sections of text

## IF SCORE < 75, PRIORITIZE THESE FIXES

### Critical Fixes (Do First)

4. **Ensure architect brief is standalone** - Could someone use it immediately?
5. **Add BASIS SIGN differentiators** to improvement section

### Important Fixes (Do Second)
1. **Add evidence for each strength/weakness** - Point to specific elements
2. **Verify data accuracy** - Actually count words, links, keywords
3. **Improve GEO citations** - Must be truly quotable
4. **Strengthen blueprint actionability** - More specific recommendations
5. **Check consistency** - Same terms, tone, positioning throughout

### Nice-to-Have Fixes (Do If Time)
1. Format consistency improvements
2. Additional examples or elaboration
3. More detailed SERP context
4. Expanded competitive scoring justification
5. Extra visual element documentation

**Remember:** A good analysis isn't just thorough—it's useful. If the content architect can't immediately use your analysis to create better content, you need to revise.
