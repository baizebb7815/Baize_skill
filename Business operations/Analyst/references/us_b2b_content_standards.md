# US B2B Content Standards & Best Practices

## Purpose
This guide defines content standards specific to **US-based B2B buyers** in the **signage, manufacturing, construction, and retail industries**. Use these standards to evaluate competitor content and create BASIS SIGN content that resonates with the target audience.

---

## Audience Characteristics

### Primary B2B Buyers

**Small Business Owners (Solo/Small Teams)**
- Decision-maker: Owner directly
- Budget conscious but value-focused
- Time-poor (wants quick answers)
- Prefers straightforward communication
- Values practical, actionable advice
- Concerned about ROI and long-term costs

**Mid-Size Business Managers**
- Decision-maker: Operations/facilities manager with owner approval
- Balances cost with quality
- Needs to justify purchase internally
- Wants detailed specs and comparisons
- Values reliability and warranties
- Concerned about downtime/installation disruption

**Commercial Contractors/Project Managers**
- Decision-maker: Project manager, purchasing agent
- Price-sensitive but quality-aware
- Needs fast lead times
- Values technical accuracy
- Concerned about code compliance
- Wants reliable schedules

**Sign Shop Owners/Installers**
- Decision-maker: Shop owner, lead fabricator
- Knows the industry well (sophisticated buyer)
- Values installation ease and support
- Needs consistent quality
- Concerned about labor costs
- Wants good margins

### Key Differentiators from Other Markets

**US B2B vs Consumer:**
- Focus on **total cost of ownership** not just upfront price
- Need **technical specifications** not just features
- Want **compliance/certification** details
- Expect **professional relationships** not transactional
- Value **speed and reliability** over creativity

**US B2B vs International B2B:**
- Expect **imperial measurements** (feet, inches, pounds)
- Value **made in USA** / domestic manufacturing
- Need **UL/NEC compliance** (US standards)
- Prefer **direct communication** (less formal than some cultures)
- Want **same-day/fast support** (time zone matters)

## Content Tone & Voice Standards

### Tone Characteristics

**Professional but Approachable**
✅ "Our pre-assembled channel letters save installation time and reduce labor costs by up to 60%."
❌ "Hey! Check out these AWESOME signs that'll blow your mind!"

**Confident but Not Arrogant**
✅ "With 25 years of experience, we understand the challenges sign installers face."
❌ "We're the best in the business. No one else comes close."

**Technical but Accessible**
✅ "UL-listed LED modules have a rated L70 lifespan of 50,000 hours—about 11 years at 12 hours daily operation."
❌ "Advanced photometric distribution with optimized lumens-per-watt efficacy leveraging cutting-edge solid-state technology."

**Helpful Advisor, Not Salesperson**
✅ "Consider your mounting surface—brick requires different anchors than metal panels."
❌ "Buy now before this limited-time offer expires! Act fast!"

### Language Guidelines

**DO Use:**
- Active voice ("We manufacture" not "is manufactured by us")
- Specific data ("reduces cost by 40%" not "very cost-effective")
- Industry terminology correctly ("returns," "raceway," "transformer")
- Second person ("you" and "your") for engagement
- Concrete examples ("for a typical storefront" not "in most cases")
- Imperial units (feet, inches, pounds, gallons)

**DON'T Use:**
- Marketing hyperbole ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "incredible")
- Vague adjectives without backing ("high quality," "premium," "superior")
- Jargon without explanation (define technical terms first use)
- Overly formal/stuffy language ("herein," "aforementioned," "pursuant to")
- Slang or overly casual language ("gonna," "wanna," "super cool")
- Metric units unless converting (show both: "5 meters (16.4 feet)")

---

## Formatting & Readability Standards

### Reading Level
**Target: 8th-9th grade (Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70)**

**Why:** B2B buyers want information quickly. Too complex = they leave. Too simple = seems unprofessional.

**How to achieve:**
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Paragraph length: 3-4 sentences maximum
- Use active voice
- Avoid nested clauses
- Use common words when possible ("use" not "utilize")

### Visual Hierarchy

**Headings:**
- H1: One per page, primary keyword, clear benefit or topic
- H2s: 5-7 sections, logical flow, often questions or key topics
- H3s: 2-4 per H2, break down subtopics
- H4s: Rare, only if deep detail needed

**Example hierarchy:**
```
H1: Complete Guide to Channel Letter Signs
├─ H2: What Are Channel Letter Signs?
│  ├─ H3: Definition and Components
│  └─ H3: How They Work
├─ H2: Types of Channel Letter Signs
│  ├─ H3: Front-Lit
│  ├─ H3: Back-Lit (Halo)
│  └─ H3: Combination
└─ H2: Installation Process
   ├─ H3: Planning and Permits
   ├─ H3: Mounting Methods
   └─ H3: Electrical Connection
```

### Lists & Bullets

**When to use numbered lists:**
- Sequential steps (installation process)
- Rankings or priorities
- Timelines or phases

**When to use bullet lists:**
- Features or benefits
- Options or choices
- Non-sequential items

**Best practices:**
- Parallel structure (all start with verb or all nouns)
- Keep items similar length
- 3-7 items ideal (too many = cognitive overload)
- Use fragments for bullets (no periods unless full sentences)

### Tables

**When to use:**
- Comparing 3+ items (products, materials, options)
- Presenting specifications (dimensions, power, weight)
- Showing pricing tiers
- Cost breakdowns

**Table design:**
- Clear column headers
- Left-align text, right-align numbers
- Highlight key differences
- Include units of measurement
- Mobile-responsive (stack on small screens)

## Data & Specificity Standards

### Quantification Requirements

**Always include specific numbers for:**
- Cost savings ("Save $2,500" not "save money")
- Time savings ("Install in 3 hours" not "quick installation")
- Energy consumption ("1.2 watts per foot" not "energy efficient")
- Lifespan ("50,000 hours" not "long-lasting")
- Dimensions ("24 inches tall" not "large letters")
- Performance specs ("Visible from 500 feet" not "highly visible")

### Comparison Standards

**When making comparisons:**
- Use specific data ("60% less" not "much less")
- Show both numbers ("1W vs 2.5W" not just "more efficient")
- Provide context ("saves $400 annually" not just "reduces costs")
- Be fair (compare apples to apples)
- Cite source if using industry data

**Example comparisons:**

❌ Bad:
"LED signs are better than neon."

✅ Good:
"LED channel letters consume 1-1.5 watts per linear foot compared to neon's 3.5-4 watts per foot—a 60-70% reduction in energy consumption that saves approximately $400-600 annually for a typical 20-foot sign operating 12 hours daily."

### Source Attribution

**When to cite sources:**
- Industry statistics or market data
- Technical standards (UL, NEC, IBC)
- Third-party research or studies
- Government regulations or codes
- Expert opinions or quotes

**How to attribute:**
- Inline: "According to the National Sign Research, 68% of..."
- Parenthetical: "LED technology has improved efficiency by 300% since 2010 (US Dept. of Energy, 2024)."
- Footnote/link: For detailed sources

**Authoritative sources:**
- Government sites (.gov)
- Industry associations (ISA, USSC)
- Standards organizations (UL, ANSI, NEC)
- Academic research (.edu)
- Established industry publications

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes

❌ **Too sales-y**: Pushing product before building trust
✅ **Solution:** Lead with education, show expertise, then offer solution

❌ **Too technical**: Using jargon without explanation
✅ **Solution:** Define terms, use analogies, provide examples

❌ **Too generic**: Could apply to any company
✅ **Solution:** Include specific data, unique processes, real examples

❌ **Too long**: Walls of text without structure
✅ **Solution:** Break into sections, use visuals, add white space

### Tone Mistakes

❌ **Overly formal**: "Herein we shall provide an examination of..."
✅ **Solution:** "Let's look at..."

❌ **Too casual**: "Yo, check out these sick signs!"
✅ **Solution:** "Here's why these signs work well for retail:"

❌ **Condescending**: "As any professional knows..."
✅ **Solution:** "In the signage industry, a common practice is..."

### Data Mistakes

❌ **Vague claims**: "Very energy efficient"
✅ **Solution:** "60% more energy efficient (1W vs 2.5W per foot)"

❌ **Missing context**: "Costs $500"
✅ **Solution:** "Costs $500 for materials, installed price ranges $1,200-1,800 depending on complexity"

❌ **Unverified stats**: "Studies show..."
✅ **Solution:** "According to the 2024 ISA Sign Market Report..."
