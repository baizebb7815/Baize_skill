## Competitor Differentiation

When discussing or implying competitors, emphasize:

1. **Pre-assembly advantage**
   - Most competitors ship components that require on-site assembly
   - BASIS SIGN ships ready-to-install systems

2. **Installation simplicity**
   - Competitors often require licensed electricians
   - BASIS SIGN designs can be installed by general contractors

3. **Regulatory certainty**
   - Competitors may not provide compliance documentation
   - BASIS SIGN includes UL listings and NEC compliance guides

**Tone:** Factual differentiation, not aggressive competition.

Example:
