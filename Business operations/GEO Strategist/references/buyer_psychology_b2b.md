## Language & Tone Guidelines

### What Works

✅ **Specific numbers**
- "Install in 2 hours with basic tools"
- "Save $800-1200 in electrician fees"
- "Ships within 7-10 business days"

✅ **Outcome-focused**
- "Get your storefront noticed"
- "Pass inspection on first try"
- "Reduce installation delays"

✅ **Confidence through transparency**
- "Here's exactly what's included"
- "Our process, step by step"
- "What you can expect"

### What Doesn't Work

❌ **Vague claims**
- "Premium quality"
- "Industry-leading"
- "Best in class"

❌ **Jargon without context**
- "IP65-rated polycarbonate housing"
- (Better: "Weatherproof casing rated for outdoor use")

❌ **Excessive enthusiasm**
- "Amazing!"
- "Incredible value!"
- "You won't believe!"

**Why:** B2B buyers are skeptical of hype. They trust data, specs, and transparency.
