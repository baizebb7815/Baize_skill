## Language & Tone Guidelines

### What Works

✅ **Warm & personal**
- "Your wedding, your way"
- "Create something special"
- "Make it uniquely yours"

✅ **Reassuring & supportive**
- "We'll help you every step"
- "No experience needed"
- "Risk-free guarantee"

✅ **Inspiring & aspirational**
- "Light up your celebration"
- "Create memories that glow"
- "Make your space shine"

### What Doesn't Work

❌ **Corporate or cold**
- "Purchase our product"
- "Achieve optimal results"

❌ **Overly technical**
- "12V DC LED module array"
- (Better: "Safe, low-voltage LED lights")

❌ **Pushy or aggressive**
- "Buy now before it's too late!"
- "Limited time only!"
- (Unless genuinely time-sensitive)

**Why:** B2C buyers respond to emotion, not pressure. They want to feel **inspired**, **supported**, and **confident**.

---

## Visual Design Principles

### Hero Section
- **Large, beautiful product photo** in aspirational setting
- Soft, warm lighting
- Real-looking spaces (not sterile studios)
- People enjoying the product (optional but powerful)

### Product Gallery
- Diverse settings (weddings, homes, parties, businesses)
- Mix of professional shots + customer photos
- Close-ups showing quality + wide shots showing context
- Lifestyle images > white background

### Customer Photos Section
- Authentic, unfiltered (but high-quality)
- Captions with names and context ("Sarah & Mike's Wedding")
- Mix of settings and styles
- "Share yours" encouragement

### Trust Elements
- Star ratings visually prominent (gold stars)
- Review snippets with real names and photos
- Certification badges clean and recognizable
- Social media icons/feeds integrated

---

## Mobile-First Considerations

B2C buyers often browse on mobile:

1. **Hero image** must look stunning on small screens
2. **CTA buttons** large and thumb-friendly
3. **Mockup tool** must work on mobile
4. **Product gallery** swipeable, not clickable
5. **Reviews** scannable (not walls of text)

---

## Seasonal & Event-Driven Messaging

### Wedding Season (Spring/Summer)
- "Make your big day glow"
- "Photo-perfect wedding decor"

- "Light up your celebrations"
- Gift messaging and wrapping

### New Year (Jan)

### Year-Round
