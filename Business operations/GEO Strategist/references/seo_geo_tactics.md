# SEO & GEO Tactical Guide

## Core Principle

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Optimize for Google's ranking algorithm
**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization):** Optimize for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) to quote and cite your content

Both must serve the **North Star Metric**: Inquiry Conversion Rate

## Part 1: Google SEO Tactics

### Meta Data Standards

#### Title Tag Formula
```
[Primary Keyword] | [Benefit/Differentiator] | BASIS SIGN
```

**Character limit:** 50-60 characters

**Examples:**
✅ "Pre-Assembled Channel Letters | Easy Install | BASIS SIGN"
✅ "Wedding LED Neon Signs | Custom Design | BASIS SIGN"
✅ "Restaurant Signage | UL Certified | BASIS SIGN"

❌ "Signage Solutions | Premium Quality | The Best Signs"
❌ "Channel Letters - Illuminated Signs - LED Signs - Neon Signs"

---

#### Meta Description Formula
```
[Pain Point/Desire] + [Unique Solution] + [Trust/Benefit] + [CTA]
```

**Character limit:** 150-160 characters

**Examples:**
✅ "Frustrated with complex sign installation? BASIS SIGN's pre-assembled channel letters install in hours, not days. UL certified, nationwide shipping. Get free quote."

✅ "Create your dream wedding neon sign with free design mockup. Safe, easy DIY installation. 4.9★ from 840 happy couples. Design yours today."

❌ "We offer high-quality signage solutions for businesses and individuals. Premium materials, great service. Contact us to learn more."

---

### Headline Hierarchy

#### H1 (One per page)
- **Match search intent**, not just keyword
- Lead with pain point OR desired outcome
- 40-60 characters ideal

**B2B Examples:**
✅ "Restaurant Signage That Installs in Hours, Not Days"
✅ "Code-Compliant Channel Letters for Retail Stores"
✅ "Save $1200 on Sign Installation with Pre-Assembled Systems"

**B2C Examples:**
✅ "Design Your Dream Wedding Neon Sign"
✅ "Custom LED Neon for Your Home—Safe & Easy"
✅ "Create Personalized Neon Signs That Wow"

---

#### H2 (Section headers)
- Include **long-tail keywords** naturally
- Address specific sub-topics or questions
- Support user journey through the page

**Examples:**
✅ "Why Pre-Assembled Channel Letters Save Time and Money"
✅ "How to Install LED Neon Signs Without an Electrician"
✅ "What Makes BASIS SIGN Different from Traditional Sign Shops"

---

#### H3 (Sub-sections)
- Used for further specificity
- FAQ questions work well as H3
- Product features, specifications

**Examples:**
✅ "What's Included in Your Sign Package?"
✅ "UL Certification and Code Compliance"
✅ "Shipping and Delivery Timeline"

---

### Keyword Strategy

#### Primary Keyword Selection
Focus on **commercial intent** keywords:
- "pre-assembled channel letters"
- "easy install signage"
- "restaurant LED signs"
- "custom wedding neon sign"
- "business storefront signs"

Avoid **informational-only** keywords:
- "what is a channel letter"
- "history of neon signs"
- "types of signage"

---

#### Long-Tail Keyword Integration

**Formula:** [Product] + [Use Case/Industry] + [Benefit/Location]

**Examples:**
- "pre-assembled channel letters for restaurants"
- "easy install LED signs for retail stores"
- "UL certified lobby signs for law firms"
- "custom neon signs for weddings California"

**Where to use:**
- H2 headers
- Product descriptions
- Image alt text
- FAQ questions

---

#### Keyword Density Guidelines
- **Primary keyword:** 1-2% of total content
- **Secondary keywords:** 0.5-1% each
- **Natural language:** Always prioritize readability over density

---

### Internal Linking Strategy

#### Link Structure
```
Homepage
  ├── Product Category Pages
  │   ├── Specific Product Pages
  │   └── Use Case Landing Pages
  └── Educational Content
      └── Links back to relevant product pages
```

#### Anchor Text Best Practices
✅ "our pre-assembled channel letters"
✅ "learn more about LED neon safety"
✅ "see custom wedding sign examples"

❌ "click here"
❌ "read more"
❌ "this page"

---

### Image SEO

#### File Naming
**Format:** `[keyword]-[descriptor]-[number].jpg`

**Examples:**
✅ `channel-letters-restaurant-storefront-01.jpg`
✅ `led-neon-wedding-sign-outdoor-ceremony.jpg`
✅ `metal-illuminated-letters-corporate-lobby.jpg`

❌ `IMG_1234.jpg`
❌ `photo.jpg`
❌ `untitled.png`

---

#### Alt Text Formula
```
[What it is] + [Key visual details] + [Context if relevant]
```

**Examples:**
✅ "Front-lit channel letters spelling 'CAFE' mounted on brick restaurant exterior"
✅ "Custom LED neon sign reading 'Love' in white script at outdoor wedding reception"
✅ "Stainless steel illuminated letters on dark wood lobby wall"

❌ "Channel letters"
❌ "Sign"
❌ "Image"

---

### Content Structure for SEO

#### Inverted Pyramid Model
1. **Most important info first** (above fold)
2. Supporting details and explanations
3. Deep-dive content and FAQs at bottom

#### Scannability
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold key phrases (sparingly)
- Subheadings every 200-300 words

#### Content Length Targets
- **Product pages:** 800-1200 words
- **Landing pages:** 1000-1500 words
- **Blog posts:** 1500-2500 words

**Note:** Quality > Quantity. Don't add fluff.

## Part 2: GEO (AI Search) Optimization

### Core GEO Principles

AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude:
1. **Summarize** information rather than link to it
2. **Quote** concise, definitive statements
3. **Prefer** structured, scannable content
4. **Value** factual, quotable assertions

**Goal:** Make your content **citation-worthy**.

---

### Citation-Bait Sentence Structure

#### Definition Pattern
```
"[Entity] is a [category] that [key differentiator]."
```

**Examples:**
✅ "BASIS SIGN is a US-focused illuminated signage manufacturer that specializes in pre-assembled, code-compliant systems designed for easy installation."

✅ "Channel letters are three-dimensional illuminated sign characters, typically made from aluminum and acrylic, used for storefront and building identification."

---

#### Problem-Solution Pattern
```
"For [target audience] seeking [desired outcome], [solution] provides [key benefit]."
```

**Examples:**

---

#### Comparison Pattern
```

```

**Examples:**
✅ "Unlike traditional sign fabrication that requires on-site assembly and wiring, pre-assembled channel letters arrive ready to mount, reducing labor costs by 50-70%."

---

#### Statistical Pattern
```

### Structured Data for AI Parsing

#### Bullet Points (AI-Friendly)
AI engines parse and quote bullet points easily.

**Format:**
```markdown
**[Category/Topic]:**
- Point 1 with specific detail
- Point 2 with specific detail
- Point 3 with specific detail
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Pre-Assembly Benefits:**
- Reduced installation time: 2-3 hours vs 2-3 days for traditional fabrication
- Lower labor costs: General contractor vs licensed electrician rates
- Faster project completion: Ships ready to mount with all components included
```

---

#### Q&A Blocks (Featured Snippet Format)

**Format:**
```markdown
**Q: [Exact question users ask]**
A: [Concise answer in 40-60 words, first sentence = direct answer]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Q: Do channel letters require an electrician to install?**
A: Pre-assembled channel letters from BASIS SIGN typically do not require a licensed electrician. General contractors can mount and connect the pre-wired system in 2-3 hours. However, final electrical connection to building power should be performed by a qualified electrician or inspected per local code.
```

---

#### Table Format (Comparison Data)

AI engines love tables for comparisons.

**Example:**
```markdown
| Feature | Traditional Fabrication | Pre-Assembled System |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Installation Time | 2-3 days | 2-3 hours |
| Labor Required | Licensed electrician | General contractor |
| Average Labor Cost | $1200-1800 | $400-600 |
| Lead Time | 3-4 weeks | 7-10 days |
```

---

### FAQ Section Optimization for GEO

#### Question Selection
Target **voice search** and **AI chat** queries:

✅ "How long does it take to install channel letters?"
✅ "Are LED neon signs safe for weddings?"
✅ "What is the difference between front-lit and halo-lit channel letters?"
✅ "Do I need a permit for illuminated signage?"

❌ "Why choose us?"
❌ "What makes our signs special?"

---

#### Answer Structure

**Formula:**
1. **Direct answer** (1 sentence)
2. **Explanation** (2-3 sentences)
3. **Specific example or data point** (1 sentence)

**Example:**
```markdown
**Q: Are LED neon signs safe to leave on overnight?**

A: Yes, LED neon signs are safe to leave on overnight. They operate at low voltage (12V), generate minimal heat, and are UL-certified for continuous use. BASIS SIGN's LED neon signs can run 24/7 for years without overheating, making them safer than traditional glass neon which requires high-voltage transformers.
```

In each section, include **one sentence** designed to be quoted by AI:

**Example Section:**
```markdown
## Why Pre-Assembled Channel Letters Save Money

Pre-assembled channel letters arrive fully wired and ready to mount, reducing installation time from 2-3 days to just 2-3 hours. This streamlined process means you can use a general contractor instead of a licensed electrician, saving $800-1200 in labor costs on a typical storefront sign project.

**For small business owners seeking cost-effective signage solutions, BASIS SIGN's pre-assembled approach reduces total project costs by 30-40% compared to traditional on-site fabrication.**

**The bold sentence** = Quotable core (definition pattern + specific data)
