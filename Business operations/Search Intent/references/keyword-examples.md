### Why This Cross-Industry Example Works

**Pain points shift by industry**:
- Construction: field worker adoption, offline capability
- Signage: installation, permits
- But framework remains: fear → search → content angle

**B2B patterns still apply**:
- Integration/compatibility concerns
- Implementation risk
- Vendor support reliability

**Search phrasing stays natural**:
- "does [software] integrate with quickbooks desktop" = real question
- Not "quickbooks integration construction software" (unnatural)
