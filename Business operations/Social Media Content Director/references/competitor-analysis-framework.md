# Competitor Analysis Framework

Ethical methodology for analyzing and recreating competitor video concepts while maintaining originality.

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Reverse-engineer the strategy, NOT the execution.**

We extract:
- Topic/angle logic
- Retention mechanics
- Educational value
- Audience hook

We NEVER copy:
- Exact visuals
- Specific wording
- Shot-for-shot sequences
- Brand-specific elements

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Video Breakdown

When user provides a competitor video, ask:

**Basic Info:**
- Platform (TikTok/Instagram/Pinterest)?
- Video length?
- Brand/creator?

**Quick Assessment:**
- What's the main topic?
- What's the hook (first 3 seconds)?
- What problem does it solve?

---

### Step 2: Deep Structural Analysis

Use this framework to dissect the video:

#### A) Hook Analysis
**Questions:**
- How do they grab attention?
- Is it a question, statement, or visual surprise?
- What emotion/curiosity does it trigger?

**Document:**
```
Hook type: [Question / Bold claim / Visual contrast / Problem statement]
Hook text: "[Exact text]"
Why it works: [Psychological trigger]
```

#### B) Content Flow Analysis
**Questions:**
- How many distinct "beats" or sections?
- What's the narrative arc?
- Where's the payoff?

**Document:**
```
Beat 1 (0-Xs): [Description]
Beat 2 (X-Ys): [Description]
Beat 3 (Y-Zs): [Description]
Payoff: [What viewer gets]
```

#### C) Visual Strategy Analysis
**Questions:**
- What's the camera perspective?
- Shot types used?
- Visual transitions?

**Document:**
```
Camera style: [POV / Third-person / Static / Moving]
Shot breakdown: [List each distinct shot]
Visual hooks: [What catches the eye]
```

#### D) Text Overlay Analysis
**Questions:**
- How much text per screen?
- Font style/placement?
- Text pacing?

**Document:**
```
Text approach: [Minimal / Heavy / Medium]
Key phrases: [List memorable text]
Pacing: [Words per second]
```

#### E) Retention Mechanics
**Questions:**
- Why would someone watch to the end?
- Where's the "loop" (rewatchability)?
- What makes it shareable?

**Document:**
```
Retention hook: [Curiosity gap / Before-after / Step-by-step / Surprise ending]
Rewatch factor: [What detail rewards second viewing]
Share trigger: [Why someone would send to friend]
```

---

### Step 3: Extract the Core Formula

After analysis, distill into a **transferable formula**:

**Template:**
```
TOPIC: [The educational/entertainment angle]
HOOK STRATEGY: [How to grab attention]
STRUCTURE: [Narrative flow pattern]
RETENTION DEVICE: [Why people watch to end]
TARGET EMOTION: [What viewer should feel]
```

**Example Analysis:**

**Original competitor video:** "Installing LED strip lights behind TV"

**Extracted formula:**
```
TOPIC: Making home entertainment setup more immersive
HOOK STRATEGY: "Your TV setup is missing THIS"
STRUCTURE: Problem (boring setup) → Solution reveal → Installation demo → Before/after
RETENTION DEVICE: Visual transformation payoff
TARGET EMOTION: "I want that" desire
```

---

### Step 4: Ethical Recreation Strategy

Now apply the formula to our brand/product while changing everything:

**Change Checklist:**
✅ **Different visual scenes**
- Original: TV living room → **Our version:** Bedroom neon sign
  
✅ **Different camera angles**
- Original: Wide room shot → **Our version:** POV installation

✅ **Different text phrasing**
- Original: "Transform your setup" → **Our version:** "Why your wall looks empty"

✅ **Different story framing**
- Original: Gaming vibe → **Our version:** Aesthetic home decor

✅ **Same underlying logic**
- Before/after transformation ✓
- Installation simplicity ✓
- Visual impact ✓

---

### Step 5: Generate Original Content

Create our version using:

1. **Same topic angle** (e.g., "affordable home upgrade")
2. **Same retention structure** (e.g., before/after)
3. **Different execution:**
   - Our product (LED sign vs. their LED strips)
   - Our style (POV hands vs. their wide shots)
   - Our messaging (personalization vs. their immersion)

---

## 🛡️ Ethics Safeguards

### Red Lines (NEVER Cross)

❌ **Don't recreate if:**
- Competitor used unique creative concept (original song, character, storytelling)
- Video shows their proprietary product design prominently
- Content includes their brand personality/voice heavily

❌ **Don't copy:**
- Exact shot sequences
- Specific text word-for-word
- Unique visual effects/transitions
- Audio choices (songs, voiceovers)

### Green Lights (Safe to Adapt)

✅ **Do recreate:**
- Common industry topics (installation, care, comparisons)
- Standard educational formats (how-to, tips, myth-busting)
- Universal structures (before/after, step-by-step)
- General retention tactics (curiosity gaps, transformations)

---

## 📚 Common Competitor Patterns Library

Recognize these frequently used patterns and how to adapt them:

### Pattern 1: "You're Doing It Wrong"

**Competitor example:** "Stop buying expensive custom neon"

**Our adaptation:**
- **Topic:** Same (cost-saving education)
- **Hook:** Different ("What sign shops don't tell you")
- **Visuals:** Different (our product, our POV style)
- **Messaging:** Different (emphasize quality + savings)

---

### Pattern 2: "3 Things You Need"

**Competitor example:** "3 must-haves for your home bar"

**Our adaptation:**
- **Topic:** Same (home decor essentials)
- **Hook:** Different ("Your home is missing these 3 things")
- **Visuals:** Different (our signs in different rooms)
- **Messaging:** Different (focus on ambiance + personality)

---

### Pattern 3: "Watch This Transformation"

**Competitor example:** "Boring office → Dream workspace"

**Our adaptation:**
- **Topic:** Same (space transformation)
- **Hook:** Different ("Your workspace needs this upgrade")
- **Visuals:** Different (our signage, our installation style)
- **Messaging:** Different (productivity + motivation angle)

---

## 🔍 Competitive Intelligence Extraction

When analyzing competitor videos, also document:

### What's Working for Them

- Posting frequency
- Trending topics in their niche

### Gaps We Can Fill
- Topics they haven't covered
- Pain points commenters mention
- Quality/angle improvements we can make
- Underserved audience segments

---

## 🎬 Quick Recreation Workflow

For fast turnaround competitor recreations:

1. **Watch competitor video 3x**
   - First watch: General impression
   - Second watch: Note timestamps
   - Third watch: Analyze retention

2. **Extract the "why"**
   - Why is this topic relevant?
   - Why this structure?
   - Why this hook works?

3. **Reimagine with our constraints**
   - Apply our visual style guide
   - Use our product/brand angle
   - Maintain our POV aesthetic

4. **Validate originality**
   - Would side-by-side show obvious copying? → Revise
   - Could this stand alone as unique? → Approve

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Fair Use Principles (Educational Analysis)
- We analyze for learning, not replication
- Transformation must be substantial
- Original creator's market not harmed

### Attribution (When Necessary)
- If directly inspired by specific creator: Credit them in caption
- Example: "Inspired by @creator's approach to [topic], here's our take..."

### When to Skip Recreation
- Original is too unique/creative to ethically adapt
- Topic doesn't fit our brand
- Execution would require copying visuals
- Potential for brand confusion

## 🧠 Advanced: Identifying Emerging Trends

Beyond single video analysis, track:

### Trend Signals
- Multiple creators covering same topic
- Comment patterns ("How do I...?")
- Audio/music trending
- Format innovations

### How to Ride Trends Ethically
1. Identify the underlying user need
2. Address it with our unique value proposition
3. Execute in our locked visual style
4. Add our perspective/expertise

**Example:**
- Trend: "Renter-friendly decor hacks"
- Our spin: "Damage-free LED sign installation"
- Unique angle: Focus on product quality + affordability
