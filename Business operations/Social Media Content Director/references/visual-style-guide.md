# Visual Style Guide (Style Bible)

**CRITICAL:** These rules are LOCKED and must be enforced for every video output.

## 🎨 Visual Aesthetic (Non-Negotiable)

### Core Look
- **Semi-professional smartphone aesthetic**
- Natural, realistic look (NOT cinematic)
- Slightly organic, handheld feel
- Relatable to average consumers

### Lighting Rules
✅ **Use:**
- Natural daylight through windows
- Soft indoor ambient lighting
- Workshop/garage practical lighting
- Realistic storefront lighting

❌ **Avoid:**
- Dramatic cinematic lighting
- Strong color grading/LUTs
- Sunset golden hour (too stylized)
- Studio three-point lighting

### Camera Behavior
✅ **Use:**
- Static shots (locked-off camera)
- Simple push-in (slow zoom in)
- Simple pull-back (reveal context)
- Very subtle handheld movement

❌ **Avoid:**
- Complex camera movements
- Dramatic angles (high/low)
- Fast pans or whips
- Gimbal smooth movements
- Drone shots

## 👤 POV & Character System (MANDATORY)

### Default Perspective: First-Person POV

**Why POV?**
- Maximum realism
- High AI consistency
- Zero face generation errors
- Scalable & repeatable

### What to Show in Frame
✅ **Always include:**
- Hands performing actions
- Tools being used
- Products being handled
- Materials being worked with
- Installation process

❌ **Never include:**
- Human faces
- Full body shots
- Reflections showing faces
- People in background

### POV Shot Examples

**Installation POV:**
```
Camera angle: Slightly tilted down, as if looking at your own hands
Frame: Hands holding drill, LED sign, wall in background
Action: Installing mounting bracket
```

**Unboxing POV:**
```
Camera angle: Looking down into box
Frame: Hands opening packaging, product revealed
Action: Lifting sign out of protective foam
```

**Workshop POV:**
```
Camera angle: Over-the-shoulder perspective
Frame: Workbench with tools, hands assembling components
Action: Connecting wires, testing LED module
```

## 🏠 Environment & Settings

### Preferred Locations

**For B2C (Instagram/TikTok):**
- Modern home interiors (living room, bedroom, home office)
- Clean, minimalist walls
- Natural wood/neutral color backgrounds
- Cozy, aspirational home settings

**For B2B (LinkedIn/Pinterest):**
- Workshop/garage settings
- Retail storefront exteriors
- Commercial installation sites
- Clean warehouse/studio spaces

### Background Composition Rules

✅ **Use:**
- Simple, uncluttered backgrounds
- 1-2 background elements max
- Clear subject separation
- Realistic American home/business aesthetics

❌ **Avoid:**
- Busy, distracting backgrounds
- Generic white voids
- Overly staged environments
- Non-American architectural styles

---

## 📐 Composition Guidelines

### Framing Principles

**The "Triangle of Trust":**
1. **Clear subject** - Sign/product/hands always identifiable
2. **Context** - Enough background to feel real
3. **Action** - Movement/progress visible

### Shot Composition Rules

**Close-ups (60% of shots):**
- Hands + product filling 70% of frame
- Shallow depth acceptable
- Focus on detail/texture

**Medium shots (30% of shots):**
- Show context (wall, room, workspace)
- Subject still prominent (50% of frame)
- Reveal installation environment

**Wide shots (10% of shots - use sparingly):**
- Only for before/after comparisons
- Establishing context
- Final reveal shots

---

## 🎬 Camera Movement Standards

### Allowed Movements

**Static (70% of shots):**
- Locked camera, subject moves
- Ideal for: Close-ups, detail work, text overlays

**Push-in (20% of shots):**
- Slow zoom toward subject
- Speed: 2-3 seconds to complete
- Use for: Emphasizing detail, creating focus

**Pull-back (10% of shots):**
- Reveal context/environment
- Speed: 3-4 seconds to complete
- Use for: Before/after, final reveals

### Movement Speed Reference

```
Slow: Barely perceptible (trust-building pace)
Medium: Noticeable but smooth (demonstration pace)
Fast: AVOID (breaks realism)
```

## 🌈 Color & Tone

### Color Palette Philosophy
- **Realistic, not stylized**
- Natural material colors (wood, metal, LED glow)
- Warm whites and neutral tones
- Accent colors from product LEDs

### Color Grading Rules
✅ **Minimal adjustments:**
- Slight contrast boost
- Natural white balance
- Preserve true LED colors

❌ **Avoid:**
- Heavy color grading
- Cinematic LUTs
- Desaturated looks
- Artificial color shifts

---

## 🔍 Detail & Texture

### What to Emphasize

**Material Textures:**
- LED acrylic glow
- Brushed metal finishes
- Natural wood grain
- Matte wall surfaces

**Action Details:**
- Hands tightening screws
- Plugging in power cords
- Peeling protective film
- Wiping clean surfaces

### Texture Rendering Tips for AI

```
Prompt examples:
"Close-up of hands, realistic skin texture"
"Matte black metal bracket, subtle reflections"
"Warm LED glow on white acrylic, soft diffusion"
"Natural wood wall, visible grain pattern"
```

## 🚫 Common AI Generation Pitfalls to Avoid

### Face Generation Issues
❌ Never prompt: "Person installing sign"
✅ Always prompt: "POV shot of hands installing sign"

### Lighting Mistakes
❌ Avoid: "Cinematic lighting", "dramatic shadows"
✅ Use: "Natural window light", "soft ambient indoor lighting"

### Movement Errors
❌ Avoid: "Dynamic camera movement", "tracking shot"
✅ Use: "Static camera", "slow push-in on subject"

### Background Problems
❌ Avoid: "Blurred background", "studio setup"
✅ Use: "Simple living room background", "clean workshop wall"
