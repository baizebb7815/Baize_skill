# BASIS SIGN Visual System

Use this to keep the entire site visually consistent.

## Core look

- Real, credible, US-market context
- High clarity on installation and build quality
- Calm lighting; avoid over-saturated "AI glow"

## Lighting standards

- Exterior: golden hour / dusk; readable illumination without flare
- Interior: soft neutral key light; no harsh neon spill

## Composition standards

- Hero: wide establishing shot + clear sign placement
- Proof: close-ups of materials, mounting, wiring cleanliness
- Process: 3–5 step sequence, same angle family

## What to avoid

- Any text rendered in-image
- Unrealistic glow, floating letters, impossible shadows
- Ultra-cinematic bokeh that hides details
- Overly perfect surfaces that look plastic

## Trust-first shot priorities (B2B)

1. Realistic storefront hero
2. Raceway-mounted detail
3. LED module / wiring cleanliness close-up
4. Installation step clarity
5. Packaging protection / shipment safety

## Confidence-first shot priorities (B2C)

1. Lifestyle scene with safe low-voltage cues
2. Mounting kit / standoff detail
3. Room context + scale
4. Close-up of glow uniformity
