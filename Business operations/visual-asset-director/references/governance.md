# Image Governance

## File naming

- Use kebab-case.
- Include product + intent + shot type.
- Examples:
  - channel-letters-storefront-hero.webp
  - halo-lit-letters-lobby-closeup.webp
  - raceway-mounting-step-1.webp
  - led-neon-flex-home-office-lifestyle.webp

## Alt text policy

- Describe what is visible first; add product intent once.
- Keep it factual; avoid unprovable claims.
- Do not stuff keywords.
- Good:
  - "Raceway-mounted illuminated channel letters installed on a US storefront facade."
- Bad:
  - "Best cheap channel letters UL certified fast shipping guaranteed."

## Captions

- Use captions only when they reduce risk (compliance, install ease, warranty) or clarify context.
- If using entity-binding, keep it one sentence and quotable.

## Reuse strategy

- Create a core library of evergreen shots:
  - Storefront hero (front-lit)
  - Storefront hero (halo-lit)
  - Raceway close-up
  - LED module inside return close-up
  - Installation step set (3–5 images)
  - Material close-ups (304 stainless, acrylic face, trim cap)
  - Packaging/protection shot

## Safety & legal

- Avoid depicting competitor logos, copyrighted brand marks, or recognizable trademarked sign designs.
- Avoid generating "permit approved" stamps, UL labels, or certificates inside images.
- If compliance needs to be communicated, show generic "inspection-ready wiring" and describe compliance in captions separately.

## Icon file naming

- Use kebab-case.
- Include icon + concept + size.
- Examples:
  - icon-easy-install-24.svg
  - icon-ul-components-48.svg
  - icon-permit-support-48.svg

## Icon usage notes

- Prefer SVG for UI icons.
- If the generator outputs raster, trace to SVG for consistent scaling.
