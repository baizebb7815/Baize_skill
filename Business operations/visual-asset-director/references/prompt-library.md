# Prompt Library (universal)

Use these building blocks to assemble prompts quickly.

## Universal guardrails (always include)

- No text, no watermark, no labels, no UI overlays
- Photorealistic materials; realistic wiring and mounting
- Real US context (storefront architecture, streetscape)
- Avoid competitor brand identifiers and copyrighted logos

## Aesthetic boosters (optional, use sparingly)

Use these to upgrade cover/hero images and premium brand shots. Avoid on instructional steps where clarity matters more.

### Material fidelity stack

- High texture fidelity: visible micro-scratches, brushed metal grain, acrylic edge polish, subtle powder-coat texture
- Precision fabrication: clean seams, even lighting diffusion, realistic fasteners and standoffs

### Lighting stack

- Museum lighting: controlled key light + soft fill + subtle rim light, clean shadows, no harsh glare
- Cinematic studio: large softbox look, gentle falloff, contour-defining rim light

### Camera stack

- Medium-format editorial look, crisp micro-contrast, natural color grading
- Macro product look: 85–100mm, f/5.6–f/8, tack-sharp details, clean background separation

### Composition stack

- Wide hero banner: ultra-wide framing (21:9), strong negative space, subject anchored to one side
- Architectural realism: straight verticals, believable scale, no exaggerated perspective

## Style presets

### Preset A - US storefront realism (B2B trust)
