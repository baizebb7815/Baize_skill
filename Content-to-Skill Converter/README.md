# Content-to-Skill Converter

A Claude skill that transforms tutorials, blog posts, articles, and documentation into production-ready, reusable Claude skills.

## Overview

This skill automates the process of converting educational content into structured skills that Claude can use to help users. It analyzes content deeply, extracts actionable procedures, generates comprehensive examples, and packages everything into a complete skill ready for deployment.

## What This Skill Does

**Input**: Any educational or instructional content
- Uploaded files (PDF, Markdown, TXT, DOCX, HTML)
- URLs to blog posts or documentation
- Pasted text from articles or tutorials

**Output**: A complete skill package including:
- `SKILL.md` - Main skill file with procedures, examples, and best practices
- `evals/evals.json` - Test cases to verify skill behavior
- `examples/` - Sample code or data files (when applicable)
- `README.md` - Usage instructions

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you have:
- A tutorial you reference frequently and want built into Claude
- Documentation that you want to make more accessible through conversation
- A blog post with valuable procedures you want to preserve as a skill
- Any educational content that would be useful as a reusable capability

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Provide content in any format:**
   ```
   "Turn this tutorial into a skill: [paste content]"
   "I uploaded a PDF guide, please skillify it"
   "Create a skill from https://example.com/tutorial"
   ```

2. **Claude will:**
   - Analyze the content structure
   - Ask clarifying questions about scope and triggers
   - Generate a complete skill package
   - Provide you with downloadable files

3. **Review and refine:**
   - Claude shows you what was created
   - You can request changes, additions, or adjustments
   - Iterate until the skill meets your needs

### Advanced Options

**Quick Conversion Mode**:
```
"Turn this into a skill but keep it simple, I just need the basics"
```
Claude skips detailed confirmations and generates a functional skill quickly.

**Interactive Mode** (default):
```
"I want to make a skill but I want to be involved in the process"
```
Claude collaborates with you through each phase, showing drafts and asking for input.

**Batch Processing**:
```
"I have three related articles on the same topic. Can you create one unified skill?"
```
Claude analyzes multiple sources together and creates a cohesive skill.

## Examples

- Includes working examples and troubleshooting

### Example 2: Converting a Blog Post

**User**: "Make a skill from this React hooks article: [URL]"

**Result**: Skill that:
- Explains when to use different hooks
- Provides code examples for each hook type
- Covers common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Includes edge cases and advanced patterns

### Example 3: Converting API Documentation

**User**: "Turn this API reference into a skill"

**Result**: Skill that:
- Structures API endpoints clearly
- Shows request/response examples
- Explains parameters and their effects
- Includes authentication and error handling

## What Makes a Good Source for Skill Creation

**Best sources:**
- ✅ Step-by-step tutorials with clear procedures
- ✅ Guides with examples and code snippets
- ✅ Documentation with best practices
- ✅ Articles explaining "how to" do something
- ✅ Reference material with structured information

**Less ideal sources:**
- ❌ Opinion pieces without actionable content
- ❌ News articles or announcements
- ❌ Content without clear procedures or examples
- ❌ Highly contextual or time-sensitive information

## Skill Quality Features

Skills generated by this converter include:

1. **Clear Trigger Conditions**: Specific phrases that activate the skill
2. **Structured Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions with rationale
3. **Comprehensive Examples**: Real-world scenarios and code samples
4. **Best Practices**: Do's and don'ts extracted from source
5. **Edge Cases**: Handling unusual situations
6. **Evaluation Cases**: Tests to verify skill works correctly
7. **Troubleshooting**: Common problems and solutions

## Installation

Once your skill is generated:

1. **Download the skill files** from the outputs Claude provides
2. **Place in your skills directory** (location depends on your setup)
3. **Test the skill** using the example prompts Claude provides
4. **Iterate if needed** - skills can be refined based on usage

## Customization

You can customize:
- **Skill Name**: What the skill is called
- **Trigger Scope**: How broadly the skill activates
- **Detail Level**: Amount of explanation in procedures
- **Examples**: Types and number of examples included
- **Target Audience**: Beginner-friendly vs. expert-oriented

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide complete content**: Full tutorials work better than fragments
2. **Be specific about intent**: Tell Claude what you want to emphasize
3. **Review the analysis**: Confirm Claude understood the content correctly
4. **Test the evaluation cases**: Make sure they cover important scenarios
5. **Iterate**: First version is rarely perfect - refine as needed

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Claude doesn't trigger the skill when I provide content
- **Solution**: Use explicit phrases like "turn this into a skill" or "skillify this"

**Problem**: Generated skill is too broad/narrow
- **Solution**: Provide feedback on trigger scope during the design phase

**Problem**: Missing important details from source
- **Solution**: Point out what's missing; Claude will add it

**Problem**: Examples aren't relevant
- **Solution**: Describe what scenarios you want covered
